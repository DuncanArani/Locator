<div class="col-xs-8">“I’m still Shoo. Yes, I’m living with HIV, but I’m still</br> the exact same person.” That awareness is what led Shoo Robbins, a</br> 30-year-old talent agent in Nashville, Tennessee, to tell his family</br> about his diagnosis within 24 hours of finding out he was HIV-positive. “The only way that my family would be OK would be for me to tell</br> them face to face, for them to see me and touch me and look in my eyes and see that I’m still exactly the same person.”</div>

"Stopping your HIV regimen will likely result in return of the HIV virus to</br> pre-treatment levels and a loss in CD4 cells heading towards your previous low level. That will put you at increasead risk for AIDS and non-AIDS related</br> serious health concerns. I would discuss with your HIV specialist to see if<br> there is an alternative (such as atazanvir or nevirapine) to the Stocrine</br> (efavirenz) avhailable to you since that is the drug most likely making your feel high."
